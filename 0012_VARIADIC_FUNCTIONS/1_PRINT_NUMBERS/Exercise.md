# Exercise: Variadic Function with counted arguments

## **Task**

Write a C program that performs the following tasks:

1. Prompts the user to enter a positive integer `n`, which represents the number of elements in an array.
2. Dynamically allocates memory for an array of `n` integers.
3. Prompts the user to enter `n` integers to fill the array.
4. Print the output as shown in the example outputs below.

---

## **Requirements**

1. You must use a variadic function method to handle the input of integers.

---

## **Example Output**
